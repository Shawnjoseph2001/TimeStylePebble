Inspired by the visual language of the Timeline found on the Pebble Time, TimeStyle is designed as the “present” to complement the Timeline’s “past” and “future”.

* Readable: With more than 80% of the display area devoted to the time and 6 font options, TimeStyle is designed for readability in all conditions. Unlike most other Pebble faces, time text is displayed using antialiasing, achieved using palette swapping.
* Colorful: includes over 20 preset color schemes, and also supports custom colors using any color the Pebble Time can display&mdash;also supports saving, loading, and sharing custom presets!
* Configurable: TimeStyle features a wide variety of different complications, including step counts, sleep times, weather forecasts, the week number, seconds, the time in another time zone, the battery level, and more.
* Keeps you informed: TimeStyle automatically displays notifications when the battery is low or when your phone disconnects.
* Works in 30 different languages, more than any other Pebble face: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, Czech, Slovak, Portuguese, Greek, Swedish, Polish, Romanian, Vietnamese, Catalan, Norwegian, Russian, Estonian, Basque, Finnish, Danish, Lithuanian, Slovenian, Hungarian, Croatian, Serbian, Irish, Latviann, and Ukrainian.
